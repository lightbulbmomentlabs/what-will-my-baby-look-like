# Watermark Image Instructions

Please save the provided watermark PNG logo as:
`watermark.png`

This file should be placed in this directory (`/public/images/`) so it can be accessed as `/images/watermark.png`

The watermark system is configured to:
- Position: Bottom-left corner
- Size: 50% of image width
- Opacity: 80% (semi-transparent)
- Margins: 50px from left and bottom edges

After adding the watermark.png file, the system will automatically apply it to all generated baby images.
